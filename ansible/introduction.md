### Installation:&#x20;

```

Try command `ansible`:

ansible
```

In my case, I got an error here:&#x20;

```vim
devops@1337:~$ ansible
 ERROR: Ansible requires the locale encoding to be UTF-8; Detected ISO8859-1.
```

I fixed this issue with the given commands:&#x20;

locale
export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
```

Then,&#x20;

```
ansible
