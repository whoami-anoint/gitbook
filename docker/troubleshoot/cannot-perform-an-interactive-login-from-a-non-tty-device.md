Method (1)

Update your aws credentials within the the bash of the jenkins server. With the following commands:

```
sudo -su jenkins
aws configure
```



Method (2)

Another method

1. Make directory in `/var/lib/jenkins` that called .aws (or copy .aws folder from home directory if you already configured your aws credentials via "aws configure" command)
2. Then go down to `/var/lib/jenkins/.aws` and write `sudo shown -R jenkins ./` to change owner for files in .aws directory.



You can check again with the given command:&#x20;

```
aws configure list
```
